Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa referred Bhagavān throughout Gītā . Bhagavān ultimate Absolute Truth . Absolute Truth realized three phase understanding , namely Brahman , impersonal all-pervasive spirit ; Paramātmā , localized aspect Supreme within heart living entity ; Bhagavān , Supreme Personality Godhead , Lord Kṛṣṇa . Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam ( 1.2.11 ) conception Absolute Truth explained thus : vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate “ Absolute Truth realized three phase understanding knower Absolute Truth , identical . phase Absolute Truth expressed Brahman , Paramātmā Bhagavān. ” three divine aspect explained example sun , also three different aspect , namely sunshine , sun ’ surface sun planet . One study sunshine preliminary student . One understands sun ’ surface advanced . one enter sun planet highest .
